## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned using the flex property in combination with ```"display: flex"``` to make content scale to the size of a container and scale with it when the container is resized.

Code snippets, see below:

```css
#signup-section{
    padding: 30px;
    flex: 1;
    background-color: hsl(179, 62%, 43%);
    border-radius: 0 0 0 10px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [scrimba flexbox tutorial videos](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-flexbox-c0k) - This helped me understand creating resizable flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [scrimba bonus responsive navbar tutorial video](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-flexbox-cOk/~ob/) - This is an amazing tutorial video which helped me begin understanding the concept of media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
